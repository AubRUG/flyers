        ``Why You Should Learn Ruby on Rails''

          {\small
          Which tools for building web applications should you take the
          time to learn and become experienced with? Ruby on Rails is a web
          application framework designed to build database backed
          web applications. It is especially desirable for developers and
          companies who want to quickly build web applications that can scale
          and evolve over time. In this presentation we'll learn how and why
          and even do some live coding and demos.
